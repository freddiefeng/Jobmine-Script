This contains the php script that is supposed to run as a cronjob. The cronjob runs every 10 minutes.
Once every 10 minutes has been selected to not put too much load on the jobmine server.

Registering on the webpage http://blackberryhackernews.com/jobmine adds the user to the database, and the next time 
the script runs the new user is checker.

The script is very basic and hopefully by sharing the source it will become more improved in terms of securtiy and functionality.
